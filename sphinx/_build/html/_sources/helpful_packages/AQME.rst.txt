=========

Automated QM Environments (or AQME) is an in-house Python package from 
the Paton group, and is an ensemble of automated QM workflows that can 
be run through Jupyter Notebooks, command lines, and yaml files. 
Workflows include conformational sampling, post-processing of QM output 
files to fix errors, generation of ready-to-run QM files, and generation 
of semi-empirical descriptors in json and csv files (and more).

GoodVibes is an in-house Python package from the Paton group designed to compute 
thermochemical values from 
electronic structure frequency calculations. This program allows a user to 
collect energy, enthalpy, entropy, and free energies from quantum chemistry 
output files at variable temperatures and concentrations, while applying a 
variety of useful corrections including quasi-harmonic entropy corrections, 
zero-point energy corrections, and frequency scaling. Other features include 
Boltzmann averaging, relative energy and thermochemistry calculations and 
plotting, and duplicate checking.

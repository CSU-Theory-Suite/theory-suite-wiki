=========

DIStributing Computed Outputs (or DISCO) is an in-house Python script from 
the Paton group used to parse through Gaussisan NBO and GIAO outputs for 
atomistic and molecular properties. DISCO collects NBO atomic charges, NMR 
tensor values, and/or NMR chemical shifts, HOMO, LUMO, and bond distance values.

REGression Generator and AnalyzEr (or REGGAE) is an in-house R-language script 
from the Paton group for 
statistical analysis of datasets. Statistical diagnostics include linear and 
non-linear regression modeling, feature selection, data splitting, pairwise 
correlations, ANOVA and QSAR analysis, PCA, and cross-validation analysis. 
Users can also generate plots for these analyses.

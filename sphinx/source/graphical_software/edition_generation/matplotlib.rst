==========
Matplotlib
==========

Although matplotlib is not included in the standard library of python it is a 
python library widely used by pythonists. Quoting the 
`official webpage <https://matplotlib.org/>`__ : 

.. 
   
   Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, 
   and interactive visualizations in Python.

The official webpage has lots of resources for its users including the Code API,
cheatsheets as well as examples. For installation please follow their 
`getting started <https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/getting_started/>`__ 
section and/or their `installation guide <https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html>`__

Basics
------

Simplest usage
..............

The first thing that we are going to do is a simple plot with matplotlib and 
we will go step by step on how gain more control on the drawing through the 
different basic methods of matplotlib.

.. note:: 
   
   If I was insistent on pymol's documentation being awesome, prepare to be 
   dazzled by `matplotlib's documentation <https://matplotlib.org/>`__ 

To make things easy let's say that we want to draw some experimental points 
that are in a file name :code:`points.csv` that has the following contents: 


.. code:: none
   
   x,y
   0,1.3
   1,2.4
   2,6.0
   3,4.8
   4,7.2
   5,9.0

For tutorial purposes we are going to read the file by hand (although we could 
easily use pandas and/or numpy to read it) 

.. code:: python

   import numpy as np 

   ifile = 'points.csv'
   
   points = []
   with open(ifile,'r') as F: 
       for i,line in enumerate(F): 
           if i==0: # let's ignore the first line
               continue
           x,y = line.strip().split(',')
           points.append(float(x),float(y))

   # and now lets transform it to a np.array
   xy = np.array(points)

Great now we have a numpy array where the first column is the x of the 
experimental points and the second column is the y. If we want a simple plot we 
can use the high-level methods implemented in pyplot: 

.. code:: python

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   plt.scatter(xy[:,0],xy[:,1])
   plt.savefig('fast_figure.png') # this will save a raster image -> better to edit with GIMP
   plt.savefig('fast_figure.svg') # this will save a vector image -> better to edit with Inkscape

if we instead want only a fast visualization without saving the figure we can 
instead use 

.. code:: python 

   plt.show()

Congrats! you have drawn your first figure using matplotlib! The key idea of 
this high-level interface is to use it for "quick-and-dirty plots" as you saw, 
the figure was generated in 3 lines of code: the import, the plot and the 
saving/showing steps. 


Figure, Axes, Gridspec and kwargs
.................................

If we want to gain a bit more of control of our drawings we need to use the 
basic structures of matplotlib: :code:`Figure`, :code:`Axes` and :code:`Gridspec`

First we are going to start with the :code:`Figure`. A :code:`Figure` is a drawing and it is the
basic structure of any of our matplotlib *figures* (See, good programmers use 
fairly obvious names). 

Next we have the :code:`Axes`. A :code:`Figure` may contain multiple :code:`Axes`
and each axes may have different data drawn. Each Axes has at least a xaxis and 
a yaxis. They also have other properties that we will treat in more detail at a 
later section. For now what we need to know is that the plotting actions are 
carried out in an axes (*scatter* in our previous example), whereas drawing the 
final image (*savefig* in the previous example) is carried out in the :code:`Figure`

If we only use these two we can translate our previous example as follows: 

.. code:: python

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   ofile = 'fast_figure.svg'

   fig = plt.figure()
   ax = fig.add_subplot()
   ax.scatter(xy[:,0],xy[:,1])
   fig.savefig(ofile) 

.. note:: 

   I want to condition you to default to saving images in .svg rather than 
   showing them or saving them as .png so the following examples will only save 
   the figure as .svg instead of providing other options. 

Here we can provide some extra arguments to control the size of the figure as 
well as its quality: 

.. code:: python 

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   ofile = 'fast_figure.svg'

   width,height = 6, 6 # these values are in inches
   dpi = 150

   fig = plt.figure(figsize=(width,height),dpi=dpi)
   ax = fig.add_subplot()
   ax.scatter(xy[:,0],xy[:,1])
   fig.savefig(ofile) 

Finally we move to the :code:`Gridspec`. A :code:`Gridspec` is kind of a 
coordinate system within the figure that allows us to fine tune the positions 
of the axes within the :code:`Figure`. 

.. code:: python 

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   ofile = 'fast_figure.svg'

   width,height = 6, 6 # these values are in inches
   dpi = 150

   fig = plt.figure(figsize=(width,height),dpi=dpi,constrained_layout=False)

   # First we decide where the left and right side side of the axis are relative
   # to the figure where 0 is the left edge of the figure and 1 is the right edge
   left, right = 0.10, 0.9 

   # Next we decide where the top and bottom of the axis will be.
   # Here 0 is the bottom side of the figure and 1 is the top side of the figure.
   top, bottom = [0.95,
                  0.075]

   gs = fig.add_gridspec(left=left,right=right,top=top,bottom=bottom)

   ax = fig.add_subplot(gs[0])
   ax.scatter(xy[:,0],xy[:,1])
   fig.savefig(ofile) 


Ok. I do agree that the current code is not the most beautiful code, but note that 
1st we have comments that would not usually be there and 2nd we are not taking 
advantage of one of the core features of python and the matplotlib library, 
the :code:`kwargs`. Lets make change the code again a bit!

.. code:: python 

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   ofile = 'fast_figure.svg'

   width,height = 6, 6
   dpi = 150

   fig = plt.figure(figsize=(width,height),dpi=dpi,constrained_layout=False)

   gridspec_kwds = dict()
   gridspec_kwds['left'] = 0.1
   gridspec_kwds['right'] = 0.9
   gridspec_kwds['top'] = 0.95
   gridspec_kwds['bottom'] = 0.075

   gs = fig.add_gridspec(**gridspec_kwds)

   ax = fig.add_subplot(gs[0])
   ax.scatter(xy[:,0],xy[:,1])
   fig.savefig(ofile) 

Plot types ( .plot, .scatter, .imgshow, .bar, â€¦ )
.................................................

Now allow me to introduce some basic drawing methods that we can have in 
matplotlib (for a full list check the 
`Plot types <https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/index.html>`__ section
of the pymol documentation) At the same time we will draw multiple axes in the 
same figure and try to exploit the gridspec to manipulate their distribution.

Here we are going to use the :code:`plot`, :code:`scatter`, :code:`bar`, 
:code:`imgshow` methods to draw things on our axes. At the same time we are 
going to distribute our image so that the axes are positioned as follows: 

.. centered:: |matplotlib_canvas|

.. note:: 

   It is really usefull to draw by hand an initial sketch of how you want your 
   figure to look like in the end. After you have a sketch, build the base 
   structure of your python script to draw the figure. No need to do the plotting
   just make sure that the axes are created. Then tweak the positions and dimensions
   of the figure to make sure that they fit the layout that you want. Finally 
   proceed to do the plotting. If your plotting involves a complex logic you can 
   always create a single function per axes that takes an axes and whatever extra 
   parameters that you need, and handles all the formatting related with that 
   axes as well as the plotting. 

First let's start generating the layout: 

.. code:: python 

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   ofile = 'composite_figure.svg'

   width,height = 6, 6
   dpi = 150

   fig = plt.figure(figsize=(width,height),dpi=dpi,constrained_layout=False)

   # We create the grid_A
   gridspec_A_kwds = dict()
   gridspec_A_kwds['left'] = 0.1
   gridspec_A_kwds['right'] = 0.95
   gridspec_A_kwds['top'] = 0.95
   gridspec_A_kwds['bottom'] = 0.4
   gridspec_A_kwds['ncols'] = 1
   gridspec_A_kwds['nrows'] = 2
   gridspec_A_kwds['hspace'] = 0.1

   grid_A = fig.add_gridspec(**gridspec_A_kwds)
   subgrid_kwds = {'ncols':2,
                   'nrows':2,
                   'hspace':0.1}
   subgrid = grid_A[0].subgridspec(**subgrid_kwds)

   # We create the grid_B
   gridspec_B_kwds = dict()
   gridspec_B_kwds['left'] = 0.333
   gridspec_B_kwds['right'] = 0.666
   gridspec_B_kwds['top'] = 0.333
   gridspec_B_kwds['bottom'] = 0.05

   grid_B = fig.add_gridspec(**gridspec_B_kwds)

   # Now we create the axes
   ax_A00 = fig.add_subplot(subgrid[0,0])
   ax_A01 = fig.add_subplot(subgrid[0,1])
   ax_A10 = fig.add_subplot(subgrid[1,0])
   ax_A11 = fig.add_subplot(subgrid[1,1])
   ax_B = fig.add_subplot(grid_B[0])

   fig.savefig(ofile) 

I know, it looks like a lot of code, but it is written in this manner so that 
adapting the code for a new figure as well as to tweak its positioning is easy. 
The figure that we have just saved to see the layout will look like this: 

.. centered:: |matplotlib_composite_figure_00|

Now that we have the layout that we want let's include the different plots, 
As we have a small number of points we can directly create the array "by hand" 
rather than reading it, so in this example we will proceed in that manner.  

.. code:: python 

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import numpy as np

   ofile = 'composite_figure.svg'

   width,height = 6, 6
   dpi = 150

   fig = plt.figure(figsize=(width,height),dpi=dpi,constrained_layout=False)

   # We create the grid_A
   gridspec_A_kwds = dict()
   gridspec_A_kwds['left'] = 0.1
   gridspec_A_kwds['right'] = 0.95
   gridspec_A_kwds['top'] = 0.95
   gridspec_A_kwds['bottom'] = 0.4
   gridspec_A_kwds['ncols'] = 1
   gridspec_A_kwds['nrows'] = 2
   gridspec_A_kwds['hspace'] = 0.1

   grid_A = fig.add_gridspec(**gridspec_A_kwds)
   subgrid_kwds = {'ncols':2,
                   'nrows':2,
                   'hspace':0.1}
   subgrid = grid_A[0].subgridspec(**subgrid_kwds)

   # We create the grid_B
   gridspec_B_kwds = dict()
   gridspec_B_kwds['left'] = 0.333
   gridspec_B_kwds['right'] = 0.666
   gridspec_B_kwds['top'] = 0.333
   gridspec_B_kwds['bottom'] = 0.05

   grid_B = fig.add_gridspec(**gridspec_B_kwds)

   # Now we create the axes
   ax_A00 = fig.add_subplot(subgrid[0,0])
   ax_A01 = fig.add_subplot(subgrid[0,1])
   ax_A10 = fig.add_subplot(subgrid[1,0])
   ax_A11 = fig.add_subplot(subgrid[1,1])
   ax_B = fig.add_subplot(grid_B[0])

   # define the data to plot 
   xy = np.array([[0.0,1.3],
                  [1.0,2.4],
                  [2.0,6.0],
                  [3.0,4.8],
                  [4.0,7.2],
                  [5.0,9.0]])

   # Now let's plot !!
   ax_A00.scatter(xy[:,0],xy[:,1])
   ax_A01.plot(xy[:,0],xy[:,1])
   ax_A10.bar(xy[:,0],xy[:,1])

   # kwargs are not exclusive of gridspecs so let's use them to enforce the same
   # color for the scatter and line plot!
   ax_A11.scatter(xy[:,0],xy[:,1],color='green')
   ax_A11.plot(xy[:,0],xy[:,1],color='green')

   # Imshow allows us to plug an image, pixel by pixel within an axes, but it 
   # can also serve to draw correlation matrices which is what we are going to 
   # do here!
   correlation = np.array([[1.0,0.0,0.3,0.0],
                           [0.0,1.0,0.5,0.8],
                           [0.3,0.5,1.0,0.0],
                           [0.0,0.8,0.0,1.0]])
   img = ax_B.imshow(correlation,cmap='bwr',vmin=0,vmax=1)

   fig.savefig(ofile) 

This is how our image looks like now. 

.. centered:: |matplotlib_composite_figure_01|

As we have saved it as a .svg we can edit
it in inkscape to remove the axes labels and/or add titles, but in the next 
section we will see how to do this by hand. 

Changing axes properties and cheatsheets
........................................

I probably have not mentioned that matplotlib's documentation is very very well 
done right? Look at these amazing 
`cheatsheets <https://matplotlib.org/cheatsheets/>`__ !

Why am I mentioning this? because we are going to tune in a bit our previous 
figure remove unnecessary ticks in the axes, add titles, remove bounding boxes 
and even write some random text in our figure. 

We are going to first remove the ticks and tick labels of the x axis in the top row and 
the tick labels of the y axis of the second column.

.. code:: python 

   for ax in [ax_A00,ax_A01]: 
       ax.set_xticklabels([])

   for ax in [ax_A11,ax_A01]: 
       ax.set_yticklabels([])

We can probably agree that a x axis with missing ticks in the bar plot looks 
weird, so let's fix it!

.. code:: python

   ax_A10.set_xticks(xy[:,0])

And why not have all the y axis of the top for plots reach until 10 and a bit 
more for aesthetics ? And just to mess with the labels what about using 
non-evenly spaced ticks ? 

.. code:: python 

   a_bit = 0.1
   ymin,ymax = 0 - a_bit, 10 + a_bit
   yticks = [1, 4, 5.5, 8, 8.25, 9.7]

   for ax in [ax_A00,ax_A01,ax_A10,ax_A11]: 
       ax.set_ylim((ymin,ymax))
       ax.set_yticks(yticks)

This is how the figure currently looks like!

.. centered:: |matplotlib_composite_figure_02|

I wouldn't say that it looks beautiful, but it's up to you to make it suit your 
taste!

Now we are going to completely remove the x axis and y axis from the bottom plot
as well as the bounding box (*spines*)

.. code:: python 

   for spine in 'top bottom right left'.split(): 
       ax_B.spines[spine].set_visible(False)
   
   ax_B.xaxis.set_visible(False)
   ax_B.yaxis.set_visible(False)

And now let's add a legend to the bottom plot to the right side 

.. code:: python

   colorbar = plt.colorbar(img,ax=ax_B)

If you look at the matplotlib API documentation of 
`Colorbar <https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/colorbar_api.html#matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar>`__ 
you will see that a :code:`Colorbar` object, has an axes in the :code:`ax` attribute. 
This means that we can modify such axes as if it was any other axes. So let's 
increase the thickness of the yaxis ticks. Let's add a ylabel and modify the yticks. 

.. code:: python

   cax = colorbar.ax
   cax.set_yticks([0,0.5,1])
   cax.tick_params(axis='y',width=3.0)
   cax.set_ylabel('Color warmth',fontfamily='Serif')

.. centered:: |matplotlib_composite_figure_03|

Now our full script to generate the figure looks like this: 

.. code:: python 

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import numpy as np

   ofile = 'composite_figure.svg'

   width,height = 6, 6
   dpi = 150

   fig = plt.figure(figsize=(width,height),dpi=dpi,constrained_layout=False)

   # We create the grid_A
   gridspec_A_kwds = dict()
   gridspec_A_kwds['left'] = 0.1
   gridspec_A_kwds['right'] = 0.95
   gridspec_A_kwds['top'] = 0.95
   gridspec_A_kwds['bottom'] = 0.4
   gridspec_A_kwds['ncols'] = 1
   gridspec_A_kwds['nrows'] = 2
   gridspec_A_kwds['hspace'] = 0.1

   grid_A = fig.add_gridspec(**gridspec_A_kwds)
   subgrid_kwds = {'ncols':2,
                   'nrows':2,
                   'hspace':0.1}
   subgrid = grid_A[0].subgridspec(**subgrid_kwds)

   # We create the grid_B
   gridspec_B_kwds = dict()
   gridspec_B_kwds['left'] = 0.333
   gridspec_B_kwds['right'] = 0.666
   gridspec_B_kwds['top'] = 0.333
   gridspec_B_kwds['bottom'] = 0.05

   grid_B = fig.add_gridspec(**gridspec_B_kwds)

   # Now we create the axes
   ax_A00 = fig.add_subplot(subgrid[0,0])
   ax_A01 = fig.add_subplot(subgrid[0,1])
   ax_A10 = fig.add_subplot(subgrid[1,0])
   ax_A11 = fig.add_subplot(subgrid[1,1])
   ax_B = fig.add_subplot(grid_B[0])

   # define the data to plot 
   xy = np.array([[0.0,1.3],
                  [1.0,2.4],
                  [2.0,6.0],
                  [3.0,4.8],
                  [4.0,7.2],
                  [5.0,9.0]])

   # Now let's plot !!
   ax_A00.scatter(xy[:,0],xy[:,1])
   ax_A01.plot(xy[:,0],xy[:,1])
   ax_A10.bar(xy[:,0],xy[:,1])

   ax_A11.scatter(xy[:,0],xy[:,1],color='green')
   ax_A11.plot(xy[:,0],xy[:,1],color='green')

   correlation = np.array([[1.0,0.0,0.3,0.0],
                           [0.0,1.0,0.5,0.8],
                           [0.3,0.5,1.0,0.0],
                           [0.0,0.8,0.0,1.0]])
   img = ax_B.imshow(correlation,cmap='bwr',vmin=0,vmax=1)

   # Axes formatting 
   for ax in [ax_A00,ax_A01]: 
       ax.set_xticklabels([])

   for ax in [ax_A11,ax_A01]: 
       ax.set_yticklabels([])

   ax_A10.set_xticks(xy[:,0])

   a_bit = 0.1
   ymin,ymax = 0 - a_bit, 10 + a_bit
   yticks = [1, 4, 5.5, 8, 8.25, 9.7]

   for ax in [ax_A00,ax_A01,ax_A10,ax_A11]: 
       ax.set_ylim((ymin,ymax))
       ax.set_yticks(yticks)

   for spine in 'top bottom right left'.split(): 
       ax_B.spines[spine].set_visible(False)
   
   ax_B.xaxis.set_visible(False)
   ax_B.yaxis.set_visible(False)

   colorbar = plt.colorbar(img,ax=ax_B)
   cax = colorbar.ax
   cax.set_yticks([0,0.5,1])
   cax.tick_params(axis='y',width=3.0)
   cax.set_ylabel('Color warmth',fontfamily='Serif')

   fig.savefig(ofile) 


Colors and creating a custom colormap
.....................................

Probably you noticed the keyword :code:`cmap` before when we were using imshow. 
This keyword stands for 'color map' and we can find 
`here <https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html>`__ all the 
already existing colormaps available in matplotlib. Now we are going to create 
our own color map. and use it instead of the 'bwr' that we used previously. 

The simplest way to create a colormap is by providing a sequence of colors: 

.. code:: 

   from matplotlib.colors import LinearSegmentedColormap

   custom_colors = [(128,0,0),
                    (146,54,54),
                    (103,54,112),
                    (80,0,220),#(94,0,206),
                    (0,21,128),
                    (38,61,90),
                    (86,138,202)] 
   custom_colors = [(r/256,g/256,b/256) for r,g,b in custom_colors]
   cmap = LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list('custom',custom_colors,N=256)

Now, we can see that providing the colors in RGB can be bothersome as per each 
color that we select we need to write down three different numbers. Depending 
on where we look for those numbers they will be either between 0 and 256 or 
between 0 and 1. Here we have the same code but providing the colors in html 
notation: 

.. code:: 

   from matplotlib.colors import LinearSegmentedColormap, to_rgba

   custom_colors = ['#800000ff',
                    '#923636ff',
                    '#673670ff',
                    '#371d3bff',
                    '#263d5aff',
                    '#568acaff'] 
   custom_colors = list(map(to_rgba,custom_colors))
   cmap = LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list('custom',custom_colors,N=256)

With this we are ready to go, all that we need to do is to include this cmap 
in our previous code and we will see our new color map in action!

.. code:: python 

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import numpy as np
   from matplotlib.colors import LinearSegmentedColormap, to_rgba

   ofile = 'composite_figure.svg'

   custom_colors = ['#800000ff',
                    '#923636ff',
                    '#673670ff',
                    '#371d3bff',
                    '#263d5aff',
                    '#568acaff'] 
   custom_colors = list(map(to_rgba,custom_colors))
   cmap = LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list('custom',custom_colors,N=256)

   width,height = 6, 6
   dpi = 150

   fig = plt.figure(figsize=(width,height),dpi=dpi,constrained_layout=False)

   # We create the grid_A
   gridspec_A_kwds = dict()

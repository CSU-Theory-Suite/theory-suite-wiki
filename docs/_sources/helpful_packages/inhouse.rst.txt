GoodVibes
---------

GoodVibes is a Python package designed to compute thermochemical values from 
electronic structure frequency calculations. This program allows a user to 
collect energy, enthalpy, entropy, and free energies from quantum chemistry 
output files at variable temperatures and concentrations, while applying a 
variety of useful corrections including quasi-harmonic entropy corrections, 
zero-point energy corrections, and frequency scaling. Other features include 
Boltzmann averaging, relative energy and thermochemistry calculations and 
plotting, and duplicate checking.

DBSTEP
------

DFT-Based Steric Parameters (or DBSTEP) is a Python package for collecting 
steric parameters from 3D molecular coordinates. Steric parameters available 
include percent buried volume, Sterimol (L, Bmin, Bmax) and new vectorized 
versions of these parameters, vol2vec and Sterimol2vec. This program can be 
used from the command line or in a script to obtain steric values from a 
variety of file formats or RDKit mol objects as input. Optional output allows 
for the visualization of the parameter measurements in PyMOL.
